  {
    q: "How fast do I get my skin?",
    a: "As soon as your payment clears, our bot sends a Steam trade offer to your account — usually within seconds. Just accept the offer and the skin lands in your inventory instantly.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are trade holds and why do they happen?",
    a: "Steam applies a trade hold (up to 8 days) when the seller doesn't have Steam Mobile Guard active, or hasn't had it active for at least 7 days. Buying from verified sellers with Mobile Guard means your skin arrives with no hold.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a Steam trade URL?",
    a: "Yes. Your trade URL is how our bot delivers the skin to your inventory. Add it under Account → Trade URL. We validate that it belongs to your own Steam account before saving it.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I track my purchase?",
    a: "Every purchase appears under Account → My Trades with a live status: Processing, Trade offer sent, or Delivered. You'll see exactly where your skin is in the delivery flow.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does payment work?",
    a: "Purchases are paid from your UltraSensSkin wallet balance. Your funds are only captured once the trade offer is confirmed, so you're covered by buyer protection on every trade.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I cancel a purchase?",
    a: "If a trade offer hasn't been sent yet, contact support and we'll cancel and refund your balance. Once a skin has been delivered to your inventory the trade is final.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are float and pattern?",
    a: "Float is the exact wear value of a skin (lower is cleaner); pattern index determines the placement of a skin's design. Both are shown live on every listing so you know precisely what you're buying.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I contact support?",
    a: "You can reach us via our contact form or email at info@ultrasensskin.com. We aim to respond within 24 hours on weekdays.",
